# canon-camera-control-client
A web-based interface designed to integrate with [nodejs-canon-control-server](https://github.com/UWStout/nodejs-canon-control-server).

A complex, feature-rich font-end interface for remotely monitoring and controlling Canon cameras being managed by the nodejs-canon-control-client.  Specifically designed for Photogrammetry tasks with hundreds of cameras as an alternative to tools like Breeze Multi-Camera Array.

## Features
This client is designed for a multi-camera photogrammetry workflow and provides streamlined, wizard-like pages for:
- Batch updating of exposure settings on cameras
- Display and synchronization of these settings
- Live-viewing of a camera's view through the lens
- Basic light-metering for measurement of exposure settings
- Sequential (non-simultaneous) focusing and capture of images
- Monitoring of automatic download of images and reporting of potential errors

## Details
For more details about this project and the PARSEC project and grant that led to its creation, please see the companion project [nodejs-canon-control-client](https://github.com/UWStout/nodejs-canon-control-server)

## Updates
This project is largely maintained by a single person as part of their research (Seth Berrier, aka Olliebrown). I am an instructor at a primarily teaching-focused institution and have limited time to devote to adding features or helping to fix bugs! However, I'm always happy to hear your stories and try to help if I can.  Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you have questions or ideas to improve this work. I may not always be in a position to help, but I want to know what you are doing!
