# canon-camera-control-client
A web based interface designed to integrate with the (nodejs-canon-control-server)[https://github.com/UWStout/nodejs-canon-control-server].

This is a simple front-end interface that can connect to a running nodejs-canon-control-server and display that status of the connected cameras as well as allow basic control and configuration of those cameras. It can connect to many servers at once and show all their cameras in a single unified list. It can also apply batch changes and synchronize settings to all connected servers and cameras at once.
